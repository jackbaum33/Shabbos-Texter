"Shabbos Texter": Terminal-interactive semi automatic Whatsapp Texter using Python scripting and Selenium. The user should clone the repo and then add their own .csv files
(in my code, they are named 'thursday_names.csv','friday_names.csv','all_names.csv')
the proper format for the csv:
name,phonenumber
john,1234567890 (no whitespace or characters in phone number)

The functionalities of the program:
1. text each person in the list
2. text only a subset of the names (user can enter specific names individually)
3. start from a specific point on the list

The Shabbos Texter comes in handy when one wants to text a group of people quickly, but not using a broadcast list (which sends the exact same message to each person).
The Shabbos Texter allows for easy customizing between texts, all from the comfort of one's terminal!
The use of a virtual environment, as well as downloading selenium, are required for use.

Uae and enjoy!!!
